# Simple_HTTP_Server_In_Python
This is not mine but is based on the tutorial in the pdf. I felt like it was necessary to have something like this on github since it is useful for educational purposes. If wanting to associate it with a domain name, SERVER_PORT = 8000, might have to be changed to SERVER_PORT = 80, since port 80 is what is typically used for webservers (but i don't know). just do python3 httpserver.py, then put http://http://localhost:8000 in the browser URL bar. Use this for anything you like, so I'm not putting on a license (since its not mine technically).
